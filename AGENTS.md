# Agent Guidance

This repository has project planning documents that explain the application's goals, architecture, and workflows. Reviewing them before starting a task helps maintain alignment and avoid rework.

Recommended references:

- `Implementation Plan.md` for current milestones and high-level roadmap.
- The `ProjectPlans/` directory for detailed plans on services, UI, configuration, processing, and more.

When beginning work, skim any relevant plan files to get context and ensure your changes fit within the broader vision.
